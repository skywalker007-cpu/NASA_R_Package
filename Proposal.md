## 1. Project Title
**nasaR: An R Package for Accessing NASA's Space Data**

## 2. Team Members
- [Team Member 1 Name]
- [Team Member 2 Name]
- [Team Member 3 Name]

## 3. API Selection
**API Name:** NASA Open APIs  
**Why this API?**  
We chose NASA’s Open APIs due to their rich scientific data, which includes real-time space imagery, planetary exploration data, and asteroid tracking information. This API offers immense potential for data visualization, aligns with educational goals by making space science accessible, and provides a unique opportunity to bridge astronomy with statistical analysis in R.

## 4. Project Objectives
The `nasaR` package aims to:  
- Provide intuitive functions to access NASA’s Mars Rover Photos, Astronomy Picture of the Day (APOD), and Near-Earth Object (NEO) data.  
- Offer user-friendly data visualization tools for plotting space-related information.  
- Ensure robust error handling and comprehensive documentation to enhance usability for R users of all levels.

## 5. Expected Functions & Features
The package will include the following key functions:  
- **`get_apod()`**: Fetches the Astronomy Picture of the Day, including the image and its description.  
- **`get_mars_photos()`**: Retrieves recent images captured by the Curiosity Rover on Mars.  
- **`get_neo_data()`**: Fetches details about Near-Earth Objects and generates plots of their speed vs. distance.  
- **`get_earth_image()`**: Retrieves NASA satellite imagery based on user-specified latitude and longitude coordinates.

## 6. Data Output and Visualization
Users will interact with the data as follows:  
- **APOD**: Returns the daily image along with a descriptive caption in a clean format.  
- **Mars Rover**: Displays an image gallery of recent photos from the Curiosity Rover.  
- **Near-Earth Objects**: Produces interactive plots (e.g., asteroid sizes, speeds) using `ggplot2`.  
- **Earth Imagery**: Outputs satellite images tied to geographic coordinates, with options for customization.

## 7. Package Design & Implementation
- **Development Plan**:  
  - Use `httr` and `jsonlite` for API calls to retrieve and parse NASA data.  
  - Leverage `ggplot2` for creating high-quality visualizations.  
- **Testing**: Implement unit tests using the `testthat` package to ensure function reliability.  
- **Version Control**: Host the project on a GitHub repository, utilizing pull requests for collaborative development.

## 8. Expected Challenges & Solutions
- **Challenge**: NASA APIs impose hourly request limits.  
  **Solution**: Implement caching mechanisms to store responses locally and handle rate limits gracefully.  
- **Challenge**: JSON responses may have inconsistent structures across endpoints.  
  **Solution**: Develop robust parsing functions to standardize data extraction and handle edge cases.  

## 9. Timeline & Milestones
- **Week 1**: Test API connectivity and create initial function skeletons.  
- **Week 2**: Implement core functions (`get_apod()`, `get_mars_photos()`, etc.).  
- **Week 3**: Write user vignettes, enhance error handling, and polish visualizations.  
- **Week 4**: Conduct final testing, complete documentation, and prepare for submission.  

## 10. Conclusion
The `nasaR` package will empower R users—ranging from students to researchers—to explore NASA’s vast space data effortlessly. By combining accessible functions with powerful visualizations, it democratizes space science and fosters curiosity-driven analysis.  

**Potential Future Expansion**:  
- Integrate additional NASA endpoints (e.g., Exoplanet Archive, Solar Dynamics Observatory).  
- Add support for real-time data streaming or advanced statistical modeling of space phenomena.
